## Project Description

This Week's Challenge had two excercises:

:one: **First excercise: PyBank**
With the dataset 'budget_data.csv', composed by two columns 'Date' and 'Profit/Losses', calculate the following values:
* Total Months included in dataset
* Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* Average Change over entire period
* Greatest increase in profits (date and amount)
* Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount)

:memo: The results should align with:

The results should be printed on Terminal and in a text file called _analysis.txt_.

The final script looks like this:

ðŸ¤“ This Project is the result of the learning lessons of Module 3: Python from the Data Analysis and Visualization Boot Camp 2024. The main goal is to use the acquired habilities and knowledge in a real case. 


## Table of contents

|   3   |   folder      |          Resources             |     Contains csv file           |

## How to Use the Project
 
 * To solve the first problem: you can download the folder PyBank. The script called _main.py_ should run if you save the folders in the same directory as the script.

## Credits :alien:
The code of this project origins from: starter code provided by the Team of the Data Analysis and Visualization Boot Camp, the excercises worked in the Zoom Lessons and the Solved versions of the code. I also used help from Stackoverflow, Python Documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/) and Microsoft Copilot.
